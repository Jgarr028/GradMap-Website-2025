    <h3>Problem Description</h3>
    <p>College students and their advisor often spend a lot of time trying to figure out timing
    conflicts when preparing to register for classes. Required classes may sometimes overlap
    with each other or students having other commitments. When a required class is only
    offered at certain times, students may get stuck and unable to register which can lead to a
    delay in graduation.</p>

    <br>
    <h3>Solution</h3>
    <p>GradMap is a web app that connects to a schoolâ€™s course catalog and registration system.
    Students start by entering their degree/major, preferred time blocks and constraints. The
    app auto builds a valid plan and gives alternatives. The app will also notate when a class is
    necessary to take that semester.</p>
