    <h2>Your Roadmap to Graduation Success</h2>
    <p>Team Ruby</p>
    <p>CS410 Fall 2025</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Elevator Pitch</h3>
    <p>Gradmap is a web app that automatically builds personalized, conflict-free class schedules for students.
    It considers degree requirements, course availability, and personal preferences, then shares the plan with advisors
    for quick review and approval. By combining planning, scheduling, and advisor collaboration in one place, Gradmap saves time and keeps
    students on track to graduate.</p>

    <br>
    <h3>Problem Description</h3>
    <p>College students and their advisor often spend a lot of time trying to figure out timing
    conflicts when preparing to register for classes. Required classes may sometimes overlap
    with each other or students having other commitments. When a required class is only
    offered at certain times, students may get stuck and unable to register which can lead to a
    delay in graduation.</p>

    <br>
    <h3>Customer and End User</h3>
    <p>Gradmap is designed primarily for college students, both undergraduate and graduate, who need an easier, 
    smarter way to plan their classes. These students often face challenges balancing degree requirements, 
    limited course offering, and personal schedules. Grapmap simplifies that process by automatically generating optimized, 
    conflict-free schedules tailored to each student's academic path and preferences. 
    This includes pre-requisites and co-requisites. The secondary users are academic advisors, 
    who use the platform to review, approve, and adjust student schedles efficiently. 
    All together, Grapmap enhances communication between student and advisors, reduces any scheduling errors that can occur, 
    and ensures students graduate on time.</p>

    <br>
    <h3>Solution</h3>
    <p>GradMap is a web app that connects to a schoolâ€™s course catalog and registration system.
    Students start by entering their degree/major, preferred time blocks and constraints. The
    app auto builds a valid plan and gives alternatives. The app will also notate when a class is
    necessary to take that semester.</p>
